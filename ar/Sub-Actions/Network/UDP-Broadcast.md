Broadcast a UDP payload on a specified port

***

## Example: Send text to Twitch Speaker to be read out

```json
{
  "command": "speak",
  "id": "1234",
  "voice": "BotVoice",
  "message": "It's %user%"
}
```

Replace `BotVoice` with the alias you want TwitchSpeaker to use, and `message` with the text you would like spoken
