Actions to be performed either repeatedly or for a duration can be defined here.

When a timer becomes enabled its action will execute on the next occurence.

Unless manually overridden by another [action](/Actions), the `Timed action` will only execute again if both the `Interval` and `Lines` criteria have been met

`Enabled` states this timer is currently running

`Repeat` defines if the `Timed Action` should automatically run again once the limiting criteria are met

`Interval` Time in minutes that must elapse before the action will run again.

If `Random` is checked this becomes a lower and upper bound in seconds

`Lines` Any non-zero value will pause the action from running again until that many lines have been entered in chat

`Action` Choose the [action](Actions) to execute when the timer state becomes `Enabled`
