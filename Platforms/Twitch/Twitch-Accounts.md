## Broadcaster Account

If you want CPH to be able to monitor chat and Twitch events, a `Broadcaster` account must be defined

Press `Connect to Twitch` to automatically obtain a token 

`Auto Connect` will set CPH to connect to twitch with the defined account on startup

***

## Bot Account

By default any [sub-actions](/Sub-Actions#main) will be sent through the Broadcaster account. If you want a secondary account to send these actions / messages it can be defined here in the same way

***

## Refresh Categories

Use this to pull a current list of available Twitch categories. These can be used as variables in [sub-actions](/Sub-Actions#main) for example to change scene if category is changed to a specific game
