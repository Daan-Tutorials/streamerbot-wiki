Actions can be assigned to `Generic Action` which will trigger on every first subscription You can also assign actions to specific Tiers `Twitch Prime` `Tier 1` `Tier 2` `Tier3`

> If you assign actions to both generic and specific tiers both actions may play and if they are not in the same blocking queue they will overlap

## Per Tier & Cumulative Months Ranges

You can define ranges to assign special actions that will trigger in place of the regular ones

These ranges refer to the both the tier they subscribe at and the total time they have been subscribed for
