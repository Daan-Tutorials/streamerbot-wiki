# Welcome to Streamer.bot

Documentation for Streamer.bot. Here are the changelogs and information on all aspects of the application.

Additionally, there are channels on the Streamer.bot discord to seek help/support, share discoveries, and present what you're working on.  The application can advance/evolve optimally if we all share new/interesting ways to do things.

**This wiki is very much a work in progress, if you would like to help build this wiki with information, please get in contact with me on Discord**
