# User Interface

![ui-settings.png](/ui-settings.png)

This tab controls visibility of the various tabs in Streamerbot so you can hide functions you do not need for ease of use

There is also options for `Minimize to Tray` and `Confirmation on Close`
If you have checked the box to supress action and sub-action deletion you can re-enable it here also
