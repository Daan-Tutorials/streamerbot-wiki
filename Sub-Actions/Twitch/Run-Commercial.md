# Run Commercial

This sub action is a useful part of the Streamer.bot, this allows the broadcaster to run ad breaks on either redemption or timed or on a trigger you can choose. 

To do this first you need an action within the bot you would like it to run within or create a new one. Next in the sub actions window right click to display the sub-action menu now mouse over the twitch option and then select the run commercial option.
