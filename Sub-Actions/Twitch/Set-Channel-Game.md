# Set Channel Game 

This Sub-Action within the bot can be used to the game that is displayed on your Twitch channel. 

It has 2 ways you could do this one is a drop down menu section from the previous catergories you have streamed inor the list that twitch provides.

The second option is to use a string, So this can be manual set by you or is ideal for using the`%rawInput%` variable to capture data from a !setgame command used by your moderators or one self.

*Note: The bot account must be a moderator in your Twitch channel for this to work!*
