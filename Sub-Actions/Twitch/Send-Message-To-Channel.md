In the message field you can type out your message or use it display the data contained in `%variable(s)%`. So, as displayed in the example above the bot would send a message to your twitch chat with all the data from specified variables and plain text from the message field. 

***Example output: **Streamer.bot: command user has 7000 gil*** **
