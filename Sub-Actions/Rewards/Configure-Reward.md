To move a reward you can right click and select `Move to` which will move the selected reward to where you selected, or you can select `Move all to` which will move all the rewards to the selected group. The options you have are `Enabled`, `Paused` or `Disabled`.

## Disable not configured rewards.
Any rewards left under `Not Configured` will move to the `Disabled` Section.
