# Translations
Help translating the wiki in `Arabic`, `German`, `Spanish`, `French`, `Dutch` and `Portuguese`!

To do so you need to do a couple of things.
Download one of these files on github.

Then when you have downloaded the file translate it.
Done with translating it?, fill in this google form below
(You need to paste the text of the file you can't just drag and drop the file because of google limitations)

```# About Streamer.bot

**Streamer.bot**, supercharge your stream!

Prior to the public release, Streamer.bot, also known at one point as Channel Points Handler, was available within the VR comminuty for just over a year.  On August 20th, 2021, with the help of many amazing people, it was finally made available to everyone!

The support and seeing so many folks starting to use it, and learn it has been rather overwhelming, I never thought it would gain this much traction, and so far, there are no signs of it slowing down.

> 	**Streamer.bot** will always and forever be dedicated to the loving memory of my mother.
> 	May you rest in peace, you will be missed.  `1954-2021`

Many thanks to all those who use it, and to those who show an interest in it.
