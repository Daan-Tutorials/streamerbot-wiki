# Subscription
This event triggers when a user first subscribes themselves to the channel and has not recieved any gift subs![sub.png](/sub.png)

Actions can be assigned to `Generic Action` which will trigger on every first subscription 
You can also assign actions to specific Tiers `Twitch Prime` `Tier 1` `Tier 2` `Tier3`

> If you assign actions to both generic and specific tiers both actions will play and if they are not in the same blocking queue they will overlap
