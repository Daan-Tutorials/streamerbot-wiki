# Community Goal

In this tab you can assign actions to your Community Goal that you have set up through your Twitch dashboard. 

>NOTE: THIS DOESN'T CREATE THE COMMUNITY GOAL.

To get to this tab you need to click through the following tabs, First click the `Settings` tab next click on the `Events` tab then finally click the `Community Goal` tab. You should now see a window just like the image below.

In the image above we have 2 options one is to add an action to each time a chatter has contributed to the community goal and the other is triggered when the Community Goal is Complete/Finished.

All you need to do is create an action of each of these and assign them to the relevant triggers `Contribution` or `Finished`

On the right side of this tab you have a test area where you can emulate/test the actions you have assigned to the relevant triggers.
