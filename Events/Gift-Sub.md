# Gift Subs	

A Gift Sub event is triggered when someone buys a subscription for a named person other than themselves.

You can configure events to trigger on specific tiers or set to `Generic` to trigger on any tier
Different alerts can also be configured for `anonymous` and `non-anonymous` gifts or you can set to `Either` to trigger on both

## Multi-Month Gifting

Gift subs can also be sent at Tier 1 for 3, 6 or 12 months in advance, you can configure specific alerts for each of these, again they can be `Anonymous`, `Non-Anonymous` or `Either`

## Ranges

The ranges here refer to the total amount of gift subs at a particular tier that a user has given
Ranges can be `Generic` to match any Tier or can be set to count gifts of specific tiers only.
