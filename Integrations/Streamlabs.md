**Streamer.bot** can monitor your Streamlabs account and perform actions when `Donations` are made or `Merchandise` is purchased

For the Donations, different actions can be run based on the size of the donation. 

Both `Donations` and `Merchandise` have access to a number of text [variables](/Variables) that can be passed to your [sub-actions](/Sub-Actions)
