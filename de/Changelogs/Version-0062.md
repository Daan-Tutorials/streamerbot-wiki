Visit [Streamer.bot 0.61](Version-0.61) to see all the shiny new features and updates.

Just a small fix

* Fix double clicking on commands
* Possible startup error fix
* Fix strange behaviour with new control used for grouping in actions/commands

**NOTE** Windows Defender may give a false positive, I believe this is due to the inclusion of the Roslyn compilers which power the C# compiling capabilities. The fact they're there and there is code within the app to compile stuff itself I believe is what's causing the flagging, I'm not sure how to remedy this.
